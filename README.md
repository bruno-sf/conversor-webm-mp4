# conversor-webm-mp4
An Alpine based docker image to convert webm to mp4 without having to install ffmpeg locally which in my case is conflicting with AMD VideoCard Libs

Link:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brunoferreira/conversor-webm-mp4


Why ``this``?
-----------------------
I've been using for a time a bash alias with some useful command using the ffmpeg for converting media files.
After updating my videocard ATI/AMD I discover a pretty annoying bug that messup with my ffmpeg, after a workaround using an isolated ffmpeg instalation at /home/$USER/ffmpeg, I decide to move change my alias to something more clean using Docker. TLDR: Docker to the rescue!
